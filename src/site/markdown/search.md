#Search

To take advantage of the annotation and structure added to the index, a specific Mtas [searchComponent](search_component.html), [queryParser](search_parser.html) and [requestHandler](search_handler.html) are available. This enables the use of [CQL](search_cql.html) in both regular and specific Mtas queries. For Solr search requests, some adjustments have to be made within the [configuration](search_configuration.html).
