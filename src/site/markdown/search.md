#Search

To take advantage of the annotation and structure added to the index, a specific Mtas searchComponent and queryParser are available. This enables the use of [CQL](search_cql.html) in both regular and specific [Mtas queries](search_query.html). For Solr search requests, some adjustments have to be made within the [configuration](search_configuration.html).
