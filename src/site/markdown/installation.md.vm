#Getting started

Prebuilt jar libraries are available from the [download](download.html) page, current version is [${context.get("latestReleaseFullVersion")}](https://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=nl/knaw/meertens/mtas/mtas/${context.get("latestReleaseFullVersion")}/mtas-${context.get("latestReleaseFullVersion")}.jar) (development)

**Build from Source with Maven**

Download the source code from GitHub

``` console 
git clone git://github.com/meertensinstituut/mtas.git 
```

Build the library from the created project directory `mtas`

``` console 
mvn package 
```

After a successful build, the directory `target` will contain the new jar library.

**Installation**

Mtas can be used as plugin for [Apache Solr](https://lucene.apache.org/solr/) or as library in combination with [Apache Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/). 

- Getting started with [Mtas and Lucene](installation_lucene.html)
- Getting started with [Mtas and Solr](installation_solr.html)

or see [Mtas and Docker](installation_docker.html) to get a quick demonstration. 

Versioning follows the required version of both Solr and Lucene, the latest available version is ${context.get("latestReleaseLuceneVersion")}.
